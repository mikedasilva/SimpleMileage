SimpleMileage
=============
A simple mileage tracker app for Android 2.2+ that is designed to be easily used with the absolute minimum settings possible.

The main features of this project will be:

- Quick to start
- Large, easy-to-use buttons for 'Start', 'Pause', 'Resume' and 'Stop'
- Ability to export all your data
- Will track the date and the distance traveled



Notes:
This is my first stab at experimenting with developing an Android app. The goal here was to quickly get something up and running on the device to get a taste for the process - not for a well polished app (yet).
It is a work in progress.

Some TODOs:
- Add test cases
- Determine the proper structure for activities
- Add menu along bottom
- Add email ability for exporting
